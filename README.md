# [sandbox] DCS pilot technical documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alphagov/dcs-pilot-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alphagov/dcs-pilot-docs)

This is the documentation for the [Document Checking Sytem (DCS) pilot](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-document-checking-service-pilot-scheme)

The pages are hosted at https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital on the [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/)


# Getting Started

MUST

To see the version of Ruby used by the application, see [the ruby-version file](.ruby-version).

## Install Ruby

Start by installing [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build):
```
brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
```
This will allow you to compile Ruby, and makes it easier to manage multiple Ruby environments (macOS comes with Ruby installed, so this simplifies things).

Download the current version of Ruby that the [application uses](.ruby-version):
```
rbenv install 2.6.4 # substitute <2.6.4> with version found in .ruby-version
```

Set your Ruby version to match what `rbenv` installed in the previous step:
```
rbenv local 2.6.4 # substitute with version installed. change local to global, if wanted.
```

Install the application's dependencies:

```
bundle install
```


## Making changes
To make changes, edit the markdown files in the source folder.

Although a single page of HTML is generated, the markdown is spread across multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in `source/`.

A new markdown file is not automatically included in the generated output. If you add a new markdown file at the location `source/agile/scrum.md`, the following snippet in `source/index.html.md.erb` will include it in the generated output.

`<%= partial 'documentation/scrum' %>`

Including files manually like this enables you to specify the position they appear on the page.

The sections in the documentation are controlled by the use of markdown headers, not the file structure.

Images to be included in the docs are kept in `source/images`

In order to configure some aspects of layout, like the header, edit `config/tech-docs.yml`.

### Workflow

The repository uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/alphagov/dcs-pilot-docs/) to run a basic pre-commit. This ensures that changes do not break the application.

Before commiting any changes, the contributor should run this command in the application directory:

```
bundle exec middleman build
```

This command mimics the command run by the Travis Build Agent.

### Preview
Whilst writing documentation, you can run a middleman server to preview how the published version will look in the browser.

The preview is only available on your own computer. Others will not be able to access it if you give them the link.

Type the following to start the server:

```
bundle exec middleman server
```

If all goes well, something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.
```
Changes to the tech-docs.yml file require stopping and restarting the server to show up in the preview. You can stop it with Ctrl-C.
